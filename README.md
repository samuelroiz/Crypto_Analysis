# Crypto_Analysis


## About our project...

By VBA and Jupyternotebook, it analyzed the crypto market data to help break down variables into small pieces to allow the reader to access clean data. Also, added variables to help understand which crypto market is successful or unsuccessful. Created bar charts, linear graphs, maximum, mininum, and other codes to clean up the data.
