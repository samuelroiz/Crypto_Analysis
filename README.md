# Crypto_Analysis


## Project 

This project was created to try to understand the performance of the crypto currency, it's popularity and compare it to the performance of the dollar.

Our Objective was to answer four main questions.
1. Is crypto a good investment?
2. How does crypto compare to the dollar?
3. Did the pandemic have any effect over crypto currencues?
4. Is there a relationship between the performance of crypto currencies and the dollar?

To be able to answer this questions we took our data from two api's :
1. Nomics API
2. ExchangeRates API


The branches for this project are called: 
Sven: Here we did an analysis of the dollar in comparison to crypto currencies and a comparison of the dollar vs the bitcoin during the last year.

Value: this branch was used to retrieve and do an analysis of each separate crypto currency to be able to later plot them, here we also did some simple bar plots to understand the performance and crypto environment.

Comparison: This branch, is extremely related to the Value branch, we took that code as starter and created a user interface for the user to be able to input several currencies he is interested in and have a simple analysis and comparison of those desired currencies.

Plots: On this branch we did some more complex plots, like bubbles and a line chart for the market capfor the whole year to understand the performance of the crypto currency during the pandemic and post pandemic.

After realizing our investigation and supported in our findings we arrived at several diferent conclusions.
1. Right now and for the last year Crypto was a good and safe investment, of our 100 samples only 2 had a negative revenue result on the last 365 days. 
  Although it was a safe investment, the crypto market is mostly represented by the Bitcoin being by far the most popular, pricier and known crypto currency.
2. Crypto and the dollar have a small relationship on their performance, but there is a stronger relationship between the dollar and Bitcoin, this is the most popular and known Crypto currency. 
3. The pandemic had a big impact over Crypto currencies but it also had a bigimpact over the dollar investment.
